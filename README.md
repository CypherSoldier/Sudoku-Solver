# Sudoku-Solver

## How It Works
The program can solve any Sudoku problem by taking into account the following rules:
Rule 1 - Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
Rule 2 - Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions 
Rule 3 - The digits can only occur once per block (nonet)
Rule 4 - The sum of every single row, column, and nonet must equal 45

## Preview
Example: Imagine a Sudoku board, the -1s represent a blank space.
After running the script, the board will be filled with the correct values.
